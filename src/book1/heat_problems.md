# Solving Heat Problems

### Principle
When solving heat problems, we **must** remember:
$$Q_{released} = Q_{absorbed}$$
or, if there is heat lost to the surrounding:
$$Q_{released} = Q_{absorbed} + Q_{loss}$$

### Maths with Heat
Main ways to relate heat:
- $Q = Pt$, commonly used for $Q_{released}$
- $Q = C\Delta T$
- $Q = mc\Delta T$
