# Mole

Definition: $1\ mol = 6.02 \times 10^{23}$ (this number is given in exams)

**Example: these statements are the same**
- there are 3 mol of oxygen molecules in the container
- there are $1.806 \times 10^{24}$ oxygen molecules in the container

**explanation**: $3\ mol = 3 \times 6.02 \times 10^{23} = 1.806\times 10^{24}$

What to write in exams:
- number of oxygen molecules = $1.806 \times 10^{24}$
- number of moles of oxygen molecules = $3$
- $n = 3$ (in general gas law)


## It is the same as dozens

Definition: 1 dozen = 12

- mary has 2 dozens of egg tarts = mary has 24 egg tarts
- mary has 2 moles of oxygen molecules = mary has $1.204 \times 10^{24}$ oxygen molecules
