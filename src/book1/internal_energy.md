# Internal Energy, KE & PE

Let's explore different energies within an object

### Average kinetic energy
Kinetic theory states that particles in an object are moving/vibrating at random

Average KE depends **ONLY** on:
- Temperature $T$ ($T \propto KE_{avg}$)

### Average potential energy
Potential energy of particles arises from the force between particles
- particles farther apart means higher average PE

Average PE depends **ONLY** on:
- the state of the object
	- $PE_{gas} > PE_{liquid} > PE_{solid}$

### Total KE & PE
Total KE/PE depends on:
- Average KE/PE
- number of particles (mass)

### Internal energy
Internal energy = total KE + total PE

> When an object absorbs heat, the energy will go to its internal energy.
> It can go to both KE or PE, so we cannot know for sure without additional information.

### Misconceptions

- Change of state does **NOT** mean temperature increase/decrease
	- ie. change in average PE does not mean change in average KE
> Example: ice melting into water
> In $0\degree C$, ice and water can coexist (exist at the same time)
> some of the ice might melt into water, even without temperature change

### Concept Questions

How to increase the internal energy of an object?
- increase its mass
	- number or particles increase
- increase its temperature
	- temperature increase = avg KE increase
- change it from solid to liquid OR from liquid to gas
	- state change = avg PE change

When heating ice so that it melts into water, does its internal energy increase?
- average KE increases
	- temperature increase = avg KE increase
- average PE increases
	- change of state, solid to liquid
- Therefore, internal energy increases

When an object is heated, what happens?
- its average KE increases
	- as temperature increases
- its average PE *might* increase, but **will not decrease**
	- If the state changes, average PE increases
	- If the state does not change, average PE does not change
- Therefore, internal energy increases
