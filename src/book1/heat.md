# Heat

Heat is a form of energy transfer (like work)

> Heat is the energy transfer from one body to another (or within a body) due to a temperature difference.

Heat $Q$ has unit Joule ($J$)

- Heat flows from a region with higher temperature to a region with lower temperature.
- If the temperature difference is larger, heat transfer is faster.
- Heat transfer stops if the temperatures of the two bodies become the same.
	- They are said to have achieved **thermal equilibrium**

### Common situations

Heat flows from A to B
- ✅ temperature of A is higher than that of B
- ✅ internal energy of A is decreasing
- ✅ internal energy of B is increasing
- ❔ (*maybe*) internal energy of A + internal energy of B remains **constant**
	- result of energy conservation
	- affected by the surrounding, eg air temperature
- ❌ total kinetic energy of A > that of B
- ❌ internal energy of A > that of B
	- number of particles of B might be drastically larger than that of A

A touches B and there is no heat flow
- ✅ temperature of A = temperature of B
	- note that heat flow is caused by temperature difference
- ❌ A and B are in the same state
> Take water as an example:
> $0\degree C$ ice is put in $0\degree C$ water, what happens?
> 
> Since there is no temperature difference, there will be no heat transfer.
> Ice remains ice and water remains water.

> Additional knowledge: in the melting point, both solid and liquid can exist. Similarly, in the boiling point, both liquid and gas can exist.
