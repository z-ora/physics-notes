### s-t graph (displacement-time graph)

![](assets/s-t%20graph%201.png)

Physical meaning of slope: it is the velocity
- upward slope ($m > 1$) *(refer to $A$)*
	- object is moving away from the start
- downward slope ($m < 1$) *(refer to $C$)*
	- object is moving towards the start
- horizontal ($m = 1$) *(refer to $B$)*
	- object is stationary

Comparisons of two objects:
- more steeper slope ($m_1 > m_2 > 1$ or $m_1 < m_2 < 1$) *(compare blue and red)*
	- object 1 is moving faster than object 2
- two lines intersect *(refer to bottom left corner)*
	- objects meet (at same position)
