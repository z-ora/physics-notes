# Properties of Light


### Colour of light: the colour spectrum
The colour spectrum is made of infinitely many colours

**In DSE:** red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo ,violet

### Speed of light: $v$ and $c$
Speed of light in vacuum $c = 3 \times 10^8 \ ms^{-1}$
- It is the **fastest**

<br>

The speed of light depends on:
- the refractive index $n$ of the medium it is currently in
	- $n = \dfrac{c}{v}$
- the colour of light

<br>

Mathematically speaking:
- In vacuum/air ($n = 1$): $v = c$ no matter the colour
- In other media ($n > 1$):
	- $v < c$
	- red fastest, violet slowest
