# Refraction of light

Laws of refraction:
1. $\dfrac{sin\theta_1}{sin\theta_2}$ is constant for any refraction between two media
2. incident ray, reflected ray, refracted ray, normal all lie on the same plane

### Refracted ray compared to incident ray
- its direction changes *unless normal incidence occurs*
	- Bends towards the normal / away from the normal
	- General Snellâ€™s Law: $n_1sin\theta_1 = n_2sin\theta_2$
- its speed changes
    - $n = \dfrac{c}{v}$
- its brightness changes
	- The incident ray is the brightest, because some light is reflected and some light is refracted. The energy in the incident ray is shared by the reflected ray and the refracted ray.

### Refractive index $n$
> *"the refractive index of \[medium\] is ..."*
> 
> *"the refractive index of \[medium\] for \[colour\] light is ..."*

Refractive index is affected by:
* material of the medium
* colour of light ray
	* smallest for red, largest for violet
	* **Note:** $n$ of vacuum (and air) is $1$ for ALL colours

Vacuum/air
* Refractive index of vacuum $n_{vacuum} = 1$
* Refractive index of air $n_{air} \approx 1$
* In DSE: $n_{air} = 1$
